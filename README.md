# AI-algorithms
This repo contains AI algorithms implemented for learning purpose. It is initially created for sorting the course projects done in Uppsala University but may include other releated implementations in the future.


## File descriptions
`DMsubmit.R` implemented the A* algorithm. Descriptions for the algorithm can be found in `AI_Lab_Report_No_1.pdf`
`crocSubmit.R` implemented the Hidden Markov Model algorithm. Descriptions for the algorithm can be found in `AI_Lab_Report_No_2.pdf`
